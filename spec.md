## Features

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Objective:** Ensure the library runs seamlessly across various platforms.
- **Details:**
  - Target Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
  - Extend support to Linux and Windows using Swift’s cross-platform capabilities.
  - Use Swift’s conditional compilation (`#if os()`) to manage platform-specific code, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Example Use Case:** A game developer can use the same IK library on iOS and macOS without modification.

### 2. Inverse Kinematics Solvers
- **Objective:** Provide a variety of IK solvers to suit different needs.
- **Details:**
  - **CCD (Cyclic Coordinate Descent):** A fast, heuristic method that adjusts each joint iteratively to reach the target. Ideal for games needing quick solutions.
  - **FABRIK (Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics):** Adjusts joint positions iteratively in forward and backward passes. Great for natural-looking chains in 3D animation.
  - **Jacobian-based Methods:** Uses matrix operations for precise control, suitable for robotics requiring high accuracy.
  - Allow users to select solvers via an API (e.g., `IKSolverType.ccd` or `IKSolverType.jacobian`) based on trade-offs like speed vs. accuracy.
- **Example Use Case:** A robotics engineer selects a Jacobian solver for precise manipulator control, while a game developer opts for CCD for real-time character animation.

### 3. Joint Types
- **Objective:** Support a range of joint types with configurable properties.
- **Details:**
  - **Revolute Joints:** Rotate around one axis, with configurable angle limits (e.g., -90° to 90°).
  - **Prismatic Joints:** Slide along one axis, with distance constraints (e.g., 0 to 10 units).
  - **Spherical Joints:** Rotate freely in multiple axes, with optional cone constraints.
  - Define joints with Swift structs or classes, e.g., `struct Joint { let type: JointType; var constraints: Constraints }`.
- **Example Use Case:** A 3D character’s elbow uses a revolute joint, while a robotic gripper uses a prismatic joint.

### 4. Chain Management
- **Objective:** Enable creation and manipulation of IK chains.
- **Details:**
  - Support linear chains (e.g., arm with shoulder, elbow, wrist) and hierarchical structures (e.g., a full skeleton).
  - Provide APIs to add, remove, or connect joints and links, e.g., `IKChain.addJoint(_:)`.
  - Allow nested chains for complex setups like multi-limbed robots.
- **Example Use Case:** A game character’s arm is an IK chain, nested within a full-body hierarchy.

### 5. End Effector Goals
- **Objective:** Define flexible goals for the end effector (e.g., hand, tool tip).
- **Details:**
  - **Position Goals:** Reach a specific 3D point (e.g., `(x: 1, y: 2, z: 3)`).
  - **Orientation Goals:** Align to a specific rotation (e.g., quaternion or Euler angles).
  - **Combined Goals:** Achieve both position and orientation simultaneously.
  - Expose an API like `IKChain.setGoal(position: Vector3, orientation: Quaternion?)`.
- **Example Use Case:** A robotic arm positions a tool at a target while maintaining a specific angle.

### 6. Constraints
- **Objective:** Ensure realistic and safe joint movements.
- **Details:**
  - **Joint Constraints:** Enforce limits on angles or distances (e.g., elbow can’t bend backward).
  - **Global Constraints:** Avoid obstacles or restrict movement to a defined volume.
  - Implement via a constraint system, e.g., `struct Constraint { let type: ConstraintType; let value: Float }`.
- **Example Use Case:** A game character’s arm avoids bending unnaturally during animation.

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- **Objective:** Achieve real-time performance for demanding applications.
- **Details:**
  - Use efficient data structures (e.g., arrays for joint lists, matrices for solvers).
  - Optimize algorithms for low latency, such as minimizing iterations in CCD.
  - Leverage Swift 6’s concurrency features (e.g., actors) for parallel computation if applicable.
- **Example Use Case:** A game runs IK on 20 characters at 60 FPS without lag.

### 8. Interpolation and Animation
- **Objective:** Support smooth transitions for animation.
- **Details:**
  - Interpolate between IK solutions using linear or spline methods.
  - Provide keyframe support, e.g., `IKAnimation(keyframes: [IKPose])`.
  - Ensure compatibility with animation systems in games or 3D tools.
- **Example Use Case:** A character’s arm moves smoothly from one pose to another in a cutscene.

### 9. Integration with 3D Engines
- **Objective:** Simplify use with existing frameworks.
- **Details:**
  - Integrate with SceneKit (Apple platforms) via helper classes or extensions.
  - Provide generic interfaces for custom engines (e.g., transform data in/out).
  - Include example projects for popular setups.
- **Example Use Case:** A developer plugs the library into SceneKit for a macOS 3D app.

### 10. Robotics Support
- **Objective:** Cater to robotics-specific needs.
- **Details:**
  - Support serial manipulators (e.g., robotic arms) and parallel robots.
  - Offer API hooks for simulation tools (e.g., ROS) or hardware control.
  - Handle kinematics-specific data like Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.
- **Example Use Case:** A robotic arm uses the library to calculate joint angles for a pick-and-place task.

### 11. User Interface Tools
- **Objective:** Aid development with visualization.
- **Details:**
  - Provide optional debug tools (e.g., a simple joint visualizer).
  - Keep UI lightweight and detachable to avoid bloating the core library.
- **Example Use Case:** A developer visualizes an IK chain’s behavior during testing.

### 12. Documentation and Examples
- **Objective:** Ensure usability for all skill levels.
- **Details:**
  - Include detailed API docs, usage guides, and tutorials.
  - Provide sample projects for games (e.g., character rigging), 3D apps (e.g., animation), and robotics (e.g., arm control).
- **Example Use Case:** A beginner follows a tutorial to rig a game character in 30 minutes.

## Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

## Additional Considerations

- **Swift 6 Features:** Utilize Swift 6 enhancements like improved concurrency (e.g., async solvers) or better generics for type-safe APIs.
- **Modularity:** Structure the library with modules (e.g., `IKCore`, `IKRobotics`) so users import only what they need.
- **Extensibility:** Allow custom solvers or joints via protocols (e.g., `protocol IKSolver { func solve(chain: IKChain) }`).
- **Community:** If open-source, include a contribution guide and issue tracker for collaboration.

This specification outlines a comprehensive IK library in Swift 6 that balances flexibility, performance, and ease of use. It supports games with real-time animation, 3D applications with smooth visuals, and robotics with precise control—all while leveraging Swift’s modern features and cross-platform strengths.


# Additional Tests

1. Prismatic Joints: We need tests specifically for prismatic joints, including:
- A simple chain using only prismatic joints.
- A chain mixing prismatic with other joint types.
- Testing distance constraints for prismatic joints.
2. Spherical Joint Constraints: Add tests for cone constraints on spherical joints.
3. Combined Goals: Create tests where both position and orientation goals are set simultaneously for solvers that support it (Jacobian, potentially FABRIK if implemented).
4. FABRIK Orientation: If the FABRIK solver is intended to handle orientation goals, add tests for that. Currently, it only seems focused on position.
5. Complex Chain Structures: While testJointHierarchy exists, testing more complex branching structures (e.g., a torso with two arms) could be beneficial.
6. Global Constraints: If obstacle avoidance or volume restrictions are planned features, tests for these would be needed.
7. Edge Cases: Consider adding tests for:
- Chains with zero movable joints (just root and end effector).
- Very long chains.
- Chains where joints might occupy the same initial position.
- Goals that are exactly at the boundary of reachability.
8. Solver Parameter Variations: Test how solvers behave with different configurations (e.g., varying learningRate for Jacobian, maxIterations for all).
