# Phase Two: Test Suite Improvements Checklist

This document outlines suggested improvements for the InverseKinematics test suite.

## I. General Test Suite Enhancements

- [ ] **Parameterized Tests**: For tests repeating logic with different inputs (e.g., `Vector3D` arithmetic, various target positions for solvers), explore Swift Testing's capabilities for parameterization to reduce boilerplate and improve clarity. If not directly supported, consider helper methods that loop through test cases.
- [x] **Test Data Management**:
    - [x] For complex `KinematicChain` configurations used in multiple solver tests, create reusable factory methods or static properties to define standard robot archetypes (e.g., `createTestArm6DOF()`).
    - [ ] Consider loading complex test scenarios or robot definitions from embedded JSON/plist files for very intricate setups, promoting separation of test data and logic.
- [x] **Floating-Point Comparisons**:
    - [x] Implement a custom assertion helper or use a Swift Testing feature (if available) for comparing floating-point numbers with a specified tolerance. Example: `#expect(value: myFloat, isCloseTo: expectedFloat, tolerance: 1e-9)`.
    - [x] Ensure all floating-point comparisons consistently use an appropriate epsilon, especially for checking positions, orientations, and magnitudes after calculations.
- [x] **Assertion Clarity**:
    - [x] When using `#expect`, especially for complex conditions or in loops, ensure failure messages would be maximally informative. Swift Testing might allow adding custom messages to assertions.
- [x] **Negative Test Cases & Boundary Conditions**:
    - [x] Systematically review all public APIs and ensure there are explicit tests for error conditions, invalid inputs (e.g., NaN, empty arrays where not expected), and boundary values.
- [x] **Code Coverage Analysis**:
    - [x] Integrate a code coverage tool (e.g., Xcode's built-in coverage or `llvm-cov`) into the development workflow and CI to identify untested code paths.
    - [x] Aim for a high coverage percentage, particularly for core logic and mathematical operations.
- [x] **Test Naming and Organization**:
    - [x] Current naming (`@Suite`, `@Test`) is good. Continue this consistent structure.
    - [x] Ensure test method names clearly describe the scenario and expected outcome.
- [x] **Documentation within Tests**:
    - [x] Add comments to explain non-obvious test setups, choices of specific input values, or the rationale behind certain assertions, especially for complex solver scenarios.
- [ ] **Performance Test Assertions (`SIMDPerformanceTests.swift`)**:
    - [ ] Instead of `print()` statements for performance comparisons, implement a mechanism to assert performance metrics against a baseline or threshold, or log structured data for CI analysis. This helps in detecting performance regressions automatically.
    - [ ] Consider if `@Test(.tags(.performance))` can be used to segregate these tests for specific runs.

## II. `MathTests.swift` Specific Improvements

- [x] **`Vector3D` Tests**:
    - [x] Test `distance(to:)` and equivalent squared distance methods.
    - [x] Test utility properties/methods for zero detection and magnitude checks.
    - [x] Test normalization of a zero vector: define and test expected behavior (e.g., return zero vector, throw error, or return NaN).
    - [x] Test component-wise multiplication/division operations.
    - [x] Test boundary conditions (NaN, infinity, very large/small numbers).
- [x] **`Quaternion` Tests**:
    - [x] Test `slerp` (spherical linear interpolation) thoroughly, including edge cases (t=0, t=1, identical quaternions, diametrically opposite quaternions).
    - [x] Test conversions to/from Euler angles with various rotation sequences (if implemented).
    - [x] Test conversions to/from rotation matrices (if implemented).
    - [x] Test behavior with non-unit quaternions if operations are expected to handle them (though normalization is common).
    - [x] Test multiplication by scalar.
    - [x] Test `identity` quaternion behavior in operations.
    - [x] Test inverse and conjugate relationships.
    - [x] Test axis-angle edge cases (zero angle, full rotation, invalid axis).
- [x] **`Transform` Tests**:
    - [x] Test `fromMatrix(_:)` and `toMatrix()` if `Matrix4x4` interoperation is a feature.
    - [x] Test transforming direction vectors (which should only be affected by rotation, not translation).
    - [x] Test inverse of an identity transform.
    - [x] Test multiplication by an identity transform (left and right).
    - [x] Test a sequence of multiplications and ensure associativity holds (within tolerance).
    - [x] Test edge cases (translation-only, rotation-only transforms).

## III. `CoreTests.swift` Specific Improvements

- [x] **`Joint` Tests**:
    - [x] If other joint types exist (e.g., `FixedJoint`, `ContinuousJoint`), add specific tests for their unique behaviors.
    - [x] Test `parentTransform` more extensively: ensure it's correctly applied in the joint's `transform` calculation when it's non-identity.
    - [x] Test joint limits with angles that are exactly at the min/max.
    - [x] Test behavior when min limit > max limit (should probably be an initialization error).
- [x] **`Link` Tests**:
    - [x] Test links with zero length: ensure transformations are still valid (likely identity for position if offset is zero).
    - [x] Test `offset` in combination with `length` in `endTransform` and `transformAt(ratio:)` for non-trivial cases.
- [x] **`KinematicChain` Tests**:
    - [x] **Forward Kinematics (FK)**:
        - [x] Test FK for more complex chains (e.g., a 6-DOF arm with varied joint types and axes).
        - [x] Test FK with non-zero base and tool transforms if these are features of `KinematicChain`.
    - [x] **Jacobian Calculation**:
        - [x] Add specific tests to verify the correctness of `calculateJacobian` against known analytical Jacobians for simple configurations (e.g., 2-link planar, 3-link planar).
    - [x] **Error Handling & Edge Cases**:
        - [x] Test adding a joint or link with a duplicate ID (should it error or replace?).
        - [x] Test `setJointValues(_:)` with an array of incorrect size (should throw an error).
        - [x] Test operations (FK, Jacobian, IK) when `jointValues` haven't been set or are incompatible with the chain structure.
        - [x] Test getting/setting joint values by ID or index, and handling for invalid IDs/indices.
    - [x] **Chain Modification**:
        - [x] Test removing joints/links and ensure the chain's integrity is maintained.
        - [x] Test reordering joints/links if supported.

## IV. `SolverTests.swift` Specific Improvements

- [x] **General Solver Test Strategies**:
    - [x] **Standardized Test Robots**: Define a few standard `KinematicChain` configurations (e.g., 2-link planar, 3-link planar, a common 6-DOF industrial arm configuration) in a shared helper or extension.
    - [x] **Comprehensive Target Suite**: For each standard robot, define a suite of `Transform` targets:
        - [x] Easily reachable targets.
        - [x] Targets at the edge of the workspace.
        - [x] Unreachable targets (outside workspace).
        - [x] Targets requiring configurations near kinematic singularities.
        - [x] Targets requiring joints to be at their limits.
    - [x] **Run all applicable solvers against these standardized robot/target pairs.**
    - [x] **Convergence Verification**: For iterative solvers, don't just check if `solution.isSuccess` is true. Also verify:
        - [x] The final end-effector pose is close to the target pose within the specified tolerance.
        - [x] The number of iterations is within `maxIterations` and is reasonable.
        - [x] The reported error metric in `IKSolution` is below the tolerance.
    - [x] **Initial Guess Sensitivity**: For iterative solvers, test with a few different `initialGuess` values (e.g., zero vector, current pose, a random valid pose, a pose far from solution) to see impact on convergence.
    - [x] **Joint Limit Adherence**: Explicitly test that solutions respect joint limits. If a target is only reachable by violating limits, the solver should indicate failure or find the closest valid solution as per its design.
    - [x] **`IKParameters` Impact**: For each solver, test how varying key `IKParameters` (e.g., `tolerance`, `maxIterations`, `dampingFactor`, `stepSize`) affects the solution quality, convergence speed, and behavior near singularities.
    - [x] **Solution Uniqueness**: For kinematically redundant robots or analytical solvers with multiple solutions, test the ability to find different valid solutions (e.g., elbow up/down, different wrist configurations).
- [x] **Specific Solver Type Tests**:
    - [x] **Analytical Solvers**: Ensure all distinct solution branches are tested (e.g., `elbowUp: true/false`). Verify against known mathematical formulas.
    - [x] **Jacobian-based Solvers (`JacobianTranspose`, `DLS`, `SDLS`)**: 
        - [x] Test DLS/SDLS behavior with varying `dampingFactor` values, especially how they handle singularities (should provide a stable, albeit potentially slower or less accurate, solution).
    - [x] **`CCDSolver`**: Test with chains of varying lengths. Test `CCDWithOrientationSolver` for both position and orientation accuracy.
    - [x] **`FABRIKSolver`**: Test with multi-link chains. If `AdvancedFABRIKSolver` supports constraints (e.g., joint limits, orientation constraints), test these features thoroughly.
- [x] **Error and Exception Handling**:
    - [x] Test for correct `IKError` types being thrown (e.g., `.convergenceFailure`, `.targetUnreachable`, `.invalidParameters`, `.solverNotApplicableToChain`).
    - [x] Test scenarios where `initialGuess` is invalid (e.g., wrong number of elements).
- [x] **`IKSolution` Structure Tests**:
    - [x] Ensure `convergenceHistory` is populated correctly when requested and is of the expected format/detail.
    - [x] Test comprehensive IKSolution initialization, validation, boundary conditions, and edge cases.
    - [x] Test `isConverged` logic within `IKSolution` if it exists, based on its error metric and the tolerance used for the solve.
- [x] **Helper Functions & Test Setup**:
    - [x] Generalize the `calculateTwoLinkForwardKinematics` helper or use the `KinematicChain`'s FK method to verify solutions. A common helper `verifyIKSolution(chain: KinematicChain, solution: IKSolution, target: Transform, positionTolerance: Double, orientationTolerance: Double)` would be very useful.
    - [x] Create more `static func create...Chain()` helpers for different robot archetypes as mentioned above.

## V. `SIMDPerformanceTests.swift` Specific Improvements

- [ ] **Automated Performance Checks (Reiteration)**: This is crucial for performance-sensitive libraries.
    - [ ] Establish baseline performance metrics for key operations on target hardware/platforms.
    - [ ] Add assertions that check if current performance is within an acceptable range of the baseline (e.g., not more than 10% slower).
    - [ ] Swift Testing's `.timeLimit` is for preventing runaway tests, not for fine-grained performance assertions. Consider custom measurement and assertion logic.
- [ ] **Statistical Soundness (Optional for unit tests, good for benchmarks)**:
    - [ ] For more rigorous analysis, run performance loops multiple times and discard outliers or use statistical measures (average, median, standard deviation). This is likely beyond typical unit test scope but good for dedicated benchmark suites.
- [ ] **Clarity of Purpose**: Ensure comments clarify that these tests provide an *indication* of SIMD benefits and correctness, and are not a substitute for thorough profiling with dedicated tools like Instruments.
- [ ] **Test on Actual Target Devices/OS**: If performance is critical on specific platforms (e.g., iOS), ensure these performance tests are run on those targets as part of the CI/testing process, as SIMD performance can vary.

By addressing these points, the test suite can become more robust, maintainable, and effective at catching regressions and verifying the correctness and performance of the InverseKinematics library.
