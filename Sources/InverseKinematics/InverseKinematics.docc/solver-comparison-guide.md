// High-performance production approach
let strategies: [(algorithm: IKAlgorithmType, timeout: TimeInterval)] = [
    (.analytical, 0.001),           // Try analytical first
    (.dampedLeastSquares, 0.020),   // Fallback to reliable numerical
    (.fabrik, 0.010),              // Fast alternative
    (.cyclicCoordinateDescent, 0.030) // Last resort
]

func solveWithFallback(target: Transform) async throws -> IKSolution {
    for (algorithm, timeout) in strategies {
        if let solution = try? await solver.solveIK(target: target, algorithm: algorithm, timeout: timeout) {
            if solution.success { return solution }
        }
    }
    throw IKError.convergenceFailure
}
```

### Parameter Optimization

    let averageIterations: Double
    let averageError: Double
}

// Track metrics to optimize solver selection
let monitor = SolverPerformanceMonitor()
monitor.recordSolution(algorithm: .dampedLeastSquares, solution: solution, time: executionTime)
```

## Conclusion

The choice of inverse kinematics solver significantly impacts the performance, reliability, and capabilities of your robotics application. While analytical solvers provide optimal performance for compatible configurations, numerical methods offer the flexibility needed for general robot architectures.

For most applications, a multi-solver approach provides the best balance of performance and reliability, using fast analytical methods when possible and falling back to robust numerical methods when needed. The specific choice depends on your application's requirements for speed, accuracy, reliability, and development complexity.

Regular performance monitoring and parameter optimization ensure that your chosen solvers continue to meet application requirements as your system evolves and encounters new operating conditions.
